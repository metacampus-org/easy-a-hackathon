Smart Contract Features:

1. Student Onboarding:
   - Creates unique student records on blockchain
   - Generates immutable student hash identifiers
   - Controlled by institution administrators

2. Transcript Management:
   - Stores academic data linked to student hash
   - Timestamps all updates for audit trail
   - Ensures data integrity and immutability

3. Verification:
   - Allows public verification of academic records
   - Provides cryptographic proof of authenticity
   - Maintains student privacy through hash identifiers

4. Security:
   - Only authorized institutions can modify data
   - Students control access through their private hash
   - All operations are permanently recorded

5. Scalability:
   - Uses global state and box storage for efficiency
   - Supports multiple institutions and students
   - Gas-efficient operations on Algorand

Deployment Instructions:
1. Compile this PyTeal contract to TEAL
2. Deploy to Algorand Testnet using goal or AlgoSDK
3. Configure the application ID in the frontend
4. Grant appropriate permissions to institution administrators

Integration with Frontend:
- The TypeScript frontend calls this contract via AlgoSDK
- Student hash generation happens off-chain for privacy
- Transcript data is stored on-chain for immutability
- Verification is performed by reading blockchain state
